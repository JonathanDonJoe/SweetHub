What it is
---
SweetHub is a website/application dedicated to bringing you a way to meet
and enjoy Desserts. Staying completely focused on the Dessert portion, we've allocated
key areas/establishments that we feel are great to meet up at, and enjoy desserts.
As the creators of this website, we all enjoy going for something sweet to finish
the day, we decided to create something seperate from facebook events, where we 
can set up events dedicated to just enjoying something Sweet.


What we used
---
The following languages were used to create this website:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Express
* PSQL


MVP
---
Our minimum product, was to just get a working event creator while logged-in, that sent and stored information to our database, and rendered out an event that we could look at on our screens.

Our Stretch Goals
---
* creating a groups page/add group members/comment box
One of our stretch goals was to create a page where you could join groups/comment/socialize.
This would also entail some sort of social aspect where you could create private events/groups
and just have a secret chat, but we decided that you could do that in a personal group chat.
* User reviews after completing events
Later on, with a bit more time, we would like to implement a feature where the user
is able to leave reviews after the events have completed of the said location they chose.
* friends list/messaging system
Being able to add other users as friends for easy invitation to events, along with a mini message system would be a great feature to add in the future.
