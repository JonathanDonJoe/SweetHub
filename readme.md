What it is
---
SweetHub is a website/application dedicated to bringing you a way to meet
and enjoy Desserts. Staying completely focused on the Dessert portion, we've allocated
key areas/establishments that we feel are great to meet up at, and enjoy desserts.
As the creators of this website, we all enjoy going for something sweet to finish
the day, we decided to create something seperate from facebook events, where we 
can set up events dedicated to just enjoying something Sweet.
